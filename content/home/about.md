# Biography

Dr. Deokgun Park is an assistant professor of Computer Science and Engineering Department at the University of Texas at Arlington. His research focuses on open-ended tasks for human-level artificial intelligence (HLAI). He investigates the fundamental principle of neural information processing system such that a machine can acquire human language in a human-like way in a simulated environment.  He leads the Human Data Interaction Lab (UTA), which studies the models and the testbed for HLAI. You can read [his research statement here](files/research-statement-agi.pdf). His previous work on wearable healthcare and human computer interaction is available [here](https://intuinno.weebly.com/projects.html).
